# wastewater_viromics_sarscov2

This repository contains code and scripts for working with [Southern California
wastewater RNA viromics and SARS-CoV-2
sequencing](https://journals.asm.org/doi/full/10.1128/AEM.01448-21).  It began
as a fork of
[github.com/jasonarothman/wastewater_viromics_sarscov2/](https://github.com/jasonarothman/wastewater_viromics_sarscov2/)
and has been extended and modified for NAO-specific needs.
